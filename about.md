  Year0 is the personal blog of JD Panzer. It records a number of things, but mostly my five-year span of sobriety and the process behind it.

##Five Years

On December 23, 2012, I stopped drinking. I'd had a particularly bad night of it a few days before and finally copped to a very simple truth: I have a problem.

What started as an impulse became a resolution: five years without a drop, five yeas in which to sort my various issues out and put together a better life for myself. 

Alcoholics Anonymous works for a great many people, as do any number of twelve-steps and programs. That's not my choice, however. I chose an arbitrary time frame in which to address the underlying cause of alcohol abuse. 

For a great many different reasons, I have some difficulties with managing my emotions. Alcohol became an answer. A really poor answer.

What I'm discovering in the process is, well, everything. There are so many things to see when you open your eyes to another way, another philosophy. This, then, is my philosophy.
