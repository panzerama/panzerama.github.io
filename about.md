  Year0 is the personal blog of JD Panzer. It has as a subject a number of things, but is inspired by my five-year span of sobriety and the process behind it.

##Five Years

On December 23, 2012, I stopped drinking. I'd had a particularly bad night of it a few days before and finally copped to a very simple truth: I have a problem.

What started as an impulse, stop drinking, became a resolution: five years without a drop, five years in which to sort my various issues out and put together a better life for myself. Because 12-23-2012 started year zero, as it were, I began to think of it as the index year. It's been a concept (that beginning of things that is nothing, and building upon it) which has kept me focused during the process.

Alcoholics Anonymous works for a great many people, as do any number of twelve-steps and programs. That's not my choice, however. I chose an arbitrary time frame in which to address the underlying cause of alcohol abuse. When I do talk about sobriety, I talk primarily about what works *for me*, because no one system will work for all people.

And sobriety leads to a clearer head, and a clearer head leads to a great many things. As I round the bend now into year two, I think on a lot of different things. Some, I find, are worth commenting on. Here they are.
