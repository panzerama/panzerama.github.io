# Lessons I Learned Teaching Web Dev
I'm a relative latecomer to the world of software development. This is my third or fourth career (depending on how you define career) and when I made the decision to pursue it, I chose Seattle's City Colleges as an education path. I made that choice knowing that the courses and program were still new, and a lot of what I got out of it at the time was self-motivated.
When I was asked to come back and be a tutor after graduation, I was initially skeptical about my qualifications. The figurative ink on my paychecks from Nordstrom was still drying. I learned very quickly that my qualification was in wanting to help, not exhaustive knowledge.
I was asked to step in and help out with a web development course this past spring with very little notice. I am a mobile app developer at Nordstrom, and teaching web dev required a lot of catching up. I made some good choices, I made some bad choices, and ultimately I'll go into the next year of tutoring and teaching with a much different idea of how to help students make the most of their education.
Caveat: I am not an expert in web dev, pedagogy, or project management. My opinions are based on my professional and personal experiences and shouldn't be construed as gospel truth. I'll leave dogmatic pronouncements to the Bob Martins of the world.
