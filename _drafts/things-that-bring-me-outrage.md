###Sometimes I see things on the internet that make me angry.

I try not to let my outrage carry me away. Internet communities are already too mercurial by far; I don't particularly need to add my emotions to the mix. This does not stop me from being angry at things I see online, and from then posting those things to make known my upset.
I have to check myself sometimes, though, and ensure that my anger isn't being amplified by the rapidity and nature of the internet. It's very easy to be swept up in momentary fervor and do or say something entirely stupid. 
For instance, I see a lot of conversations about race crop up on my facebook wall, a hangover of some work I did with some Asian-American theater groups in Seattle. I follow the arguments, because they're interesting and eye-opening, and sometimes feel angry about the things they cover, but I don't let that anger sweep me into open comment. Why?
It probably won't contribute to the argument. In this case, the argument is happening about and among people that I don't share an experience with. I'm not Asian-American, so my voice isn't, at the moment, needed; it wouldn't add anything relevant to the discussion, in most cases. 
But awareness of, sharing of, adding my volume to awareness of the issue might. So I will repost about a Barbie book that [makes women interacting with computers look mildly concussed].
