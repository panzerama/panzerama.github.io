title: Things that bring me outrage

###Sometimes I see things on the internet that make me angry.

I try not to let my outrage carry me away. Internet communities are already too mercurial for their own good; I don't particularly need to add my reflexive emotions to the mix. Knowing this  does not prevent me from being angry at things I see online, and from then posting, reposting, or commenting on those things to make known my degree of upset. I try to make those responses as rational as possible, and much of the time I succeed.

I have to check myself sometimes, though, and ensure that my anger isn't being amplified by the tempestuous life cycle of internet discussions. It's very easy to be swept up in momentary fervor and do or say something entirely stupid. A friend of mine used the phrase 'tempest in a teapot' to describe [reddit's recent riots](). I think it's an apt description.  

One of the side effects of the people I've worked with and lived with is that I see a lot of conversations about race crop up on my facebook wall. Granted, post-Ferguson it would be hard for a liberal with a decently sized network not to see race-related subject matter. I follow the arguments, because they're interesting and eye-opening, and I often feel moved to opine on the  things they cover, but I don't let that anger sweep me into open comment. 

Why?

It probably won't contribute to the argument. In this case, the argument is happening about and among people that I don't share an experience with. I'm not Asian- or African-American, so the posts from veteran theater wizards and dear friends don't require my voice for the moment; my voice isn't the one needed.  

But awareness of, sharing of, adding my volume to awareness of the issue might. So I will repost about a Barbie book that [makes women interacting with computers look permanently concussed](). I will post without comment the [death of a Seattle man at the hands of police](). I will quietly inject into conversation the [clandestine observation of BlackLivesMatter activists]().

In these moments I will avoid apologizing, I will avoid using the words 'I feel', and I will avoid positing a solution. I don't believe that any of the above would be helpful, that any of it would net a positive outcome. I can certainly bear witness, and do so vocally. I can look and comprehend to the best of my abilities and shout when I need to.
