##There are ideas that linger.

They don't have to be particularly revolutionary for them to stick in my mind. Sometimes it's a few measures of a song. Other times it's a phrase. And sometimes it's a principle I picked up secondhand, like state dependent memory. Put briefly, we remember what we learn better when in a similar state of being. [There's more to say on the subject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-dependent_memory), but the gist is what appeals to me. 

I know a thing or two about bad habits.
