###Reading fantasy has always made me feel good.

A friend of mine recently said that human beings have not survived because we are aware of things, but because we ignore things. We are talented in the art of self deception, and it is this talent that has kept us alive. If we can ignore the crushing odds against us, we can muster the strength to fight against them. If we can imagine that the darkness isn't full of teeth, we can get a sound night's sleep. I personally think he's right, thought I would not have put quite the derisive tone on the phrase that he did.

Seen through that revelation, George RR Martin and JRR Tolkein are defenders of the human race. Not everyone finds their works so enthralling. Different strokes for different folks
