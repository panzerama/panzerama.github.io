title: The Bhutanese Diplomat

###I've never been to 2nd and 46th.

Which is weird, given how much I love Steven King's Dark Tower Cycle. It is one of the best fantasy series I've had the pleasure to read, and I return to it regularly, but I've been to New York a handful of times in the last two years and it has NEVER occurred to me to go look for the place in that city which anchors half the damn books. 

Go figure.

I finally did during my last visit, twice in fact, and on one of those I decided to sit and meditate. The non-profit fundraisers I work are both rewarding and exhausting, and travel only amplifies that feeling, so I felt like a little sit-down would be beneficial. 

I am not, as a rule, at home to metaphysics. I'm a skeptic by nature, and while I've sampled faith before, I've almost universally found myself alone and hungover the next (metaphorical) morning. I'm surprised to find that my exploration of Zen Buddhism has continued as long as it has. I've been sitting zazen for a few months now, and though I'm not very good at maintaining no-mind, I'm getting used to the struggle, at least. 

My lack of ability at leaving my self behind is painfully obvious, and I know this because sitting on a bench in this tiny park on the corner of 2nd and 46th, someone stopped and told me so.

###"You are working very hard at meditating."

Enter the Bhutanese Diplomat, which sounds like the beginning to a cheesy spoof Sherlock Holmes adventure. The gentleman who stopped and interrogated me on my meditation worked at the UN and was taking his lunch. My first response was a flood of self-conscious shame. White boy sitting in a park meditating: who the hell am I kidding. In accented but impeccably formed English he cut through my stammering response with a series of pointed, but not unkind, questions. I can make small-talk till the cows come home, but it is rare that I find myself conversing easily with someone about anything that actually matters. I almost cut and run, dismissing the man, but I called to mind something that someone said recently, about listening to understand, not just to respond. The idea was that most of us listen so that we can return the verbal volley and assert our control over a conversation, not the other way around. I decided to listen just for the sake of it, and respond with intent. 

It beat the hell out of sitting in a Starbucks.

The conversation started with religion: why was I meditating, and what was I meditating at. We circled briefly around religion before heading on to personal histories, families, round to life experiences and future ideas. None of it was so insightful that it prompted any lightbulbs, but I've never found a conversation with a stranger so easy. I talked effortlessly about things I don't often talk about, subjects that I usually make dismissive jokes about and sprint away from. From the stories he told, it was clear that he had conversations like this all the time, and that he went out of his way to to have them.

The conversation stopped as suddenly as it started, but it stopped naturally, which is rare and a subject that I've [expounded on before](link-elsewhere). He left to return to work, I got up and hailed a cab to JFK, adventuring bravely through the wilderness of Queens. The navigational lack of that cabbie is a story for another time. When I arrived at my gate and relaxed from the breakneck trip, I thought about the Bhutanese Diplomat, and felt much improved for the experience. 

There isn't a rose at 2nd and 46th, but I didnt' come away disappointed.
