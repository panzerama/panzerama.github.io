Sometimes, you have to just stop caring.
Sometimes, a thing that you care about, becuase that thing will affect your life, it has overwhelming consequence to your condition, because it even slightly impacts your existence, or because it is even peripherally interesting, sometimes that thing needs to be let go of.
Because caring might break you. 
Because that thing is so far above your pay grade. 
So stratospheric
So monolithically immutable
That caring about it resembles prayer to an eldritch god
Throwing wishes at an uncaring universe
Or worse, a universe that reviles wishes and will punsih you for hoping
It's so fucking far above you that stretching out your will to care will actively damage you
Give you cancer of the brain or the muscles or the fucking soul 
The kind of cancer that wakes you up from a sound sleep
After you've gone to bed full of hope and satisfaction
Or at the very least idle contentment
And jumps up and down on your face screaming
THIS IS MORTALITY BITCH, COME A'KNOCKIN
and then burrowing into you
Causing you to void yourself
by pressing up onto a critical part of your nervous system
So you have to start caring
Maybe it's easy to start caring
"I"m fed up" you say, and walk away 
go make yourself a sandwich
watch that show you keep rewatching on netflix
cause it's better than the crap you would have to watch that's new
but only because you know it
Maybe it's hard, because you care about that thing like a kitten that you found in a dumpster and nursed back to health and watched it grow into a healthy cat and fed it that food in the commercials that makes cats look like super-animals and you threw treats for it and laughed as it ran into things with cat-antics
and now you have to throw it in a river in a sack
and walk away
and cry into your ciabatta
Either way, you gotta stop caring
Go care about something else
Like your wife 
or your lycra-wrapped weekend hundred-mile bike ride on an over priced bike 
or your car
or your lycra-wrapped weekend mistress in her overpriced dress
or your kids
but maybe not the kids, 'cause they'll just disappoint you
like you disappointed your parents
which is why shit you care about happens above your sphere of control
You're not the master of the universe cause you slacked off in Sophomore English, sleeping through class because you played too many computer games and wanked off into the early morning
