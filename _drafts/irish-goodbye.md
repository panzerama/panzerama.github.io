title: The Irish Goodbye

###The Irish Goodbye isn't.

Most millenials (and I shudder to use the term) know the phrase. You're at party. You came alone, or with your significant other, and maybe you know one or two people but you're largely new to the crowd. You begin to tire, or your partner in crime has other crimes in mind, and sure, you want to say goodbye to that guy you know, but you'd have to wade through a crowd like a shark through chum just to get within spitting distance. Disappointed, and slightly shunned, you bail.

This is the Irish Goodbye, but the phrase gives lie to the actual-factual practice of good-byeing on the Emerald Isle. I get the sense that there's a similar practice in England, but I've only experienced Ireland's separation practices.
