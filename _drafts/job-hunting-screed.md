##My Resume: An Introduction

**I've been a lot of different things in the professional world.** I've taught at a daycare, produced and managed for fringe theaters, administered to the e-commerce site for a clothing company, and sold software for a charitable commerce platform. I am a self-taught programmer with an interest in design and UX and continue to study Python and the Django framework.

I've come away from these jobs with a grab bag of skills and a profound insight into the nature of the business world. My last company was acquired in the same way that a man clinging to a raft in th emiddle of the pacific in the center of a widening clutter of detritus is 'acquired' by a Coast Guard helicopter. With all the positivity and energy of a man with low budgeting requirements who has just discovered the joys of un-en-cubicled life, I throw myself into the tepid, sluggish waters of the job market. 

When I apply to a job, I apply primarily for a challenge. Not the kind of challenge that you use to fill in the form question asking for one instance where you had to deal with a pseudo-problem in a prior workplace, a question designed to test your ability to represent yourself as anything but completely and utterly perfect. I want to stare down a thing that I have not encountered before and that, finding myself presented with, I must gird my loins, and overcome with the pure force of my brain. 

Or a job that pays really, really well that isn't morally reprehensible. I'd consider hooking. Might even kill a guy. 

It's not one or the other. I'd take both money and a challenge, I really would, but I'm 30. I walked out of college in 2008 into the worst job market in 100 years with a liberal arts degree and a metric fuckton of debt. I don't expect a lot out of the world right now. Maybe I could take another sales gig. Right. That'd be the responsible thing to do. Make some money, pay down my preposterous amount of debt, help my wife pay down an even more ridiculous amount of debt, and buy some meager portion of land.

And I'm the middle class. Gotta love it.

So there it is. I'll take a challenging life or money. Which one do you have?
