##I'm getting married in just about a month.

I'm sure my behavior seems out of place to a lot of the people I know. I live and work amongst people fairly open to emotional expressions. Culture and society, particularly in the context of moi, make it more than okay for me to express emotion, they make it exceptional not to.

I am excited about getting married. My fianc√© is an amazing woman, and I love her. I'm happy, happier in a relationship than I think I've ever been. The disconnect for many of the folks I know is that I am not as amped up, as nervous as they might expect me to be. My happiness does not become giddiness. My excitement does not present as anxiety. 

It is interesting to note that these are somehow expected emotional responses. 

I would be anxious, I think, if I were any less sure about what I'm doing. I'd be giddy if I were any less content, if I were trying perhaps to suppress my doubts. I'm not doing any of those things. 

You often hear relationships or love described as crazy in movies, tv, pop songs. My love is utterly, madeningly sane, and getting married is the single most rational thing I've ever done.

We used to express our relationship in terms of a gravity well. You can circle around it for awhile, but eventually you'll fall in.

A prosaic kind of romance, sure, but its mine. I would be no more in love with my betrothed if I gushed or gibbered about the upcoming nuptials, nor if I clamped down on my emotions and pretended to be cool about the whole thing. My love just is, and while it may puzzle the shit out of my coworkers, it works pretty well for me. 

Take that, rom-coms.
