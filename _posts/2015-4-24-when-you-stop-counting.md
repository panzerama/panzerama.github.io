title: What happens when you stop counting

###I've been sober for a long time

Eight-hundred-forty-cough-cough-mumble days now. I have a widget on my phone that, like all of the apps on my phone, does the thinking for me. It counts up from December the 23rd, 2012. On occasion I look at it to remind myself. For the most part I have stopped counting.

I've stopped counting because I'm comfortable in my progress as a human being. My goal is five years of sobriety, but if I happen to be sober for a bit more than five, it will not be a tremendous problem. 

This is important becuase I have met someone recently who has been counting very small numbers, on a number of occasions, with a lot of urgency. 

I am reminded of the time I spent counting that urgently. I remember single digits and double digits and the repetition of arithmetic once I hit triple digits. I remember the celebration when I reached 365, a number that we all invest with importance and that seemed as solid a milestone as any.

I got a tattoo. I'm fond of it.

And after that, it ceased being quite such a big deal. I kept on going, more and more confident in what I was doing and less concerned with how long I had been doing it. Maybe that's the way it's supposed to be. 

For my friend, it is still important that there be numbers, and that they be counted. I haven't lost count, but I'm no longer truly counting. 

And that's okay. I hope he'll get there too.
