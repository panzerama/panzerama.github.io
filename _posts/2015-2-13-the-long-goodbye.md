title: The Long Goodbye
---

**I'm a salesman, and even in the world of emails and social media and data mining, sometimes doing business means talking to someone.** 

This isn't a chore for me, far from it. I rather enjoy talking with my clients. They work for non-proifts, and are for the most part quite nice folk. The conversations I have vary from long explanations and q&a sessions to brief, businesslike exchanges, but they all share one thing in common.

Nobody knows how to say goodbye. 

Businesslike behavior on the phone is a subject of some discussion. The phenomenon of the call center has brought about a whole new business acumen of how to end calls tactfully and professionally. Some companies script it, others train for it, and some select people with natural ability and shape them.

That doesn't solve the problem, though. Almost everyone I speak to fumbles the goodbye, and if I'm being honest I'm only marginally better at it. You could easily blame this on a breakdown in conversation, or the social contract, but I think that's too easy an answer.

Phone conversations between people who know each other are far simpler to conduct, so the setting isn't the deciding factor. The interaction depends entirely on the people and the expectations. In my case, someone is expecting an answer to a question that, no matter how they dress it up, comes down to explaining why they pay me money. That expectation is what adds tension and power play to the conversation and, it follows, the kind of blurred boundaries that lead to conversational confusion.

So what do we do about that? Nothing, really, not on an institutional level. We **can** all relax a bit on the phone. It might make it a bit easier to interact with people we want things from, or who want things from us, and leave everyone a bit happier.

And it would be a hell of a lot less awkward.
