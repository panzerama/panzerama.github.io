title: Fail Compilations are My Heroin
---

**I have a problem**

I consider myself a relatively educated man. I consider myself a man of taste. I might be a bit elitist on top of all that. 

There's something unutterably pedestrian about laughing at the inability of others to cope with the world. The skate-punks-in-training with their nuts embedded in a railing. A man in a wifebeater dodging bits of flaming frozen turkey and fryer oil. Children learning that life really doesn't care, and that this is what their parents had them for, to watch a smaller version of themselves stumble.

I feel like I shouldn't enjoy it. My well-meaning parents loaded some well-intentioned warm-and-fuzzies about how to express our feelings and violence is bad and we shouldn't be angry and violence is badder. It gave me a complex about my schadenfreude, which is unfortunate because schadenfreude is a perfectly healthy impulse. And quite a lot of fun.

My problem, then, is not that I enjoy fail compilations, which I do. I watch them in my cube at work and barely conceal a laugh beneath a snorted breat. I watch them at home when I think no one is looking. I enjoy them like an addict enjoys his drug of choice: with a healthy dose of shame. 

That, right there, is the problem. Fail compilations are my heroin, and I don't care about the bone density loss. Which I suppose is a metaphor for the brain cells I'm losing to atrophy whenever I subject them to a hit of human suffering. Or a badly stretched metaphor.

It's not a problem with a lot of consequence, except for my coworkers and the surreptitious sniggering they are subjected to. I may feel like I'm losing brain cells, but that's probably the elitism at work. Elitism, I suspect, is a more damaging habit.

I should get over myself, and I know it. There's just a part of me that can't shake the sensation that watching a man eat a patch of concrete and laughing makes me a bad person. 

Or far worse, a normal one. Gasp.

I should probably get over that elitism too.
