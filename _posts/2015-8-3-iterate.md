title: Iterate

##I'm not entirely convinced that I know what I'm doing

The statement applies to anything in my life, really. Relationships, programming, sales; sometimes I'll even get behind the wheel and have a half-second of dubious introspection. 

"I know you've been driving for 14 years, but are you sure you're qualified to operate a vehicle?"

I'm considering what I want to be **When I Grow Up** and, finding my mind turning ever more to programming, trying to link together the grab bag of skills I have into one cohesive, resume-worthy entity. I've got enough bits and pieces of skill to justify the attempt, and people around me who are far more qualified than I agree, but I will still come to a dead stop in the midst of some project and ask myself if I'm really good enough to hang my future hopes on this.

"Are you really smart enough to be trusted with a computer? You'll probably just hurt yourself."

I try to console myself by tackling a set of logic puzzles posed on [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net). Many programming interviews ask for solutions to simple problems in clever ways, and this helps me sharpen the tools needed for such gymnastics. 

One of the hangups is iterating through any given set of data in useful and efficient way. I try to tell my computer in halting, semi-literate Python, to go from **here** to **there** and then pick up all the steps in between. The computer does not always listen to me, and wed come to blows on occasion. 

I know that I know how to iterate through a numpy grid. I know that I can think from point A to point B, take points[A:B] and do something useful with them, and perhaps make them do fun tricks after. I comprehend list comprehensions. Lambda? I barely know her!

But there's always that little voice. 

"Are you really trained in the use of this brain?"

And suddenly I've opened a new tab and am halfway to reddit, because consuming r/aww is easier than thinking. 

The place that spawns these thoughts is in no way unique to my experience, of course. I am far from the only person who has these doubts, or even that doubts their own abilities with a similar frequency, but realizing this does not dull the edge of embarrassment. 

Which is precisely why I should be doing this. After everything I've taught myself to do again after putting down the drink, this shouldn't be too hard to settle. 

"Are you qualified to be a human being?"

Maybe. I won't know until I try.
