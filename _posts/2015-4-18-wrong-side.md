###How we look at where we travel

We took the train from Boston to New York today to celebrate the ageing aunts of my fianc√©. Two women with grey, short-cropped hair and the perpetual amiable arguments of the long-time married. They're good people, ones that I've been eager to meet, so a four hour train ride is a small inconvenience. 

As we rolled down the coast past cities and the spaces between, I'm working busily to edit her manuscript. Also not a hardship. She's a very good writer. As with all good writers that I know, she is busy observing something around her. In this case, the objects of interest are the buildings and open spaces stretching between someplace and Stamford, I'm not really paying that much attention. 

She turns to me and tells me that what she observes is rather depressing, that there are too many deserted or burned out buildings and waste-spaces. This makes me pay more attention, because she is not normally a maudlin person. I take care of that for the both of us. I pride myself on keeping it less than emo, but I'm a born cynic. 

I watch with her, and I see something different. What I see is, on the surface, the same. I see empty factories and non-descript commercial parks and graffiti encased freight cars. I can see how they would seem depressing. I do not find them so. 

They aren't beautiful, of course, but they are a backdrop for beautiful things. Interstitial machinery and mundane office parks are the fabric of American existence. For every historic house and notable eatery in the heart of a city, there are ten in-betweens. They are often abandoned, sometimes destroyed, but aren't really unique enough to be lost or gained. They cycle regularly, cells that refresh, die and are reborn and occasionally split in two and create lesser leaseable units for industrious real estate agents. 

What I see, then, as we roll past, is a relatively flat plain. Not that there aren't features of some interest here and there, but that taken as a whole they don't really amount to much mass, much density of interest. Voodoo Donuts in Portland has a huge spike of local interest. Pike place is full of small plateaus and bumps, the kind that that put you in mind of egg whites just ready for the pie crust. This stretch of uncertain territory has negligible interest-mass. 

It isn't depressing. It isn't uplifting or insightful. It is just is. 

And so I go back to editing her manuscript. Perhaps I am also watching Game of Thrones to try and catch up.
