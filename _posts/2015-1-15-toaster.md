C'mon toaster. Let's go. 

Okay, yes, tecnically you're a toaster *oven*. I know this already, but I don't find it a valid excuse. Especially since you keep bragging about the size of your elements or the power of your fan. Where's all that vaunted power and ability this morning, huh? 

See, I've got a jar of bacon jam that needs applying to some bread. Do I need to remind you how important that bacon jam is? It's more important than you, that's for damn sure, but because you are have inserted yourself into the process that leads from Bacon Jam to My Mouth you are marginally more important. Just important enough to curse at while waiting for you to make even the slightest mark on this toast. 

I could have managed better with a coat-hanger and a bic by now. 

Have I been working you too hard? Christmas is over, lovely shiny toaster oven! Your days of endless side-dishes and cookies and reheated plates are over. There's the better part of a year between now and then where you are only responsible for the occasional fozen Trader Joe's hors d'oeuvres, rammekins of desert, and my **toast**.

Which I note is still as pasty-pale as my Seattle-transplant, New England winter touched skin. Not a good sign for either of us. 

We can't keep going on like this. It's been a good run: that excitement we felt when we first met, the open doors and limitless possibilities; that time I named you after a cylon; so many frozen personal pizzas. I'll be sad to see the good times go, but to every season there is a time to gather together and a time to throw a useless, negligent, malignant appliance out the window and rejoice as the glass shatters across the ground.

Do you hear me? I will defenstrate you if you don't... wait, is that a... burn mark? Did you scorch my toast on one end and somehow leave the rest entirely bread-ish? 

This insult, sir, will not stand. I demand that you return my toast-that-is-not right now! My warm bread with its carbonized edge and I will try to eke some happiness out of the delicious bacon condiment and then retire from this world of machines and loathing, emulating the North Woods Hermit and eschewing all the complications of the world. 

Goodbye cruel toaster. You've won, and I retreat a broken man with his lukewarm breakfast.
