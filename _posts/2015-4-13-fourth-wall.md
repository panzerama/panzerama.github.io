title: The Fourth Wall
---

I think the fourth wall might be dead. 

We were watching Netflix’s rendition of Daredevil, consuming it in it’s entirety. This is the way it’s done. When I watch show’s like this, I’m either engaged in it actively, full focus, or I’m working on something else. Something like this post, or origami, or trimming the weird bits of toenail that make my climbing shoes an exercise in torture.

I lead a glamorous life. 

When she watches a show like this, she will do much the same as I do, minus the toenails. She’s not quite so gauche as I am. If she is not invested in a show, that is. If she is, she will occasionally research it in mid stream. This happens quite often with shows in established ‘verses, like the Marvel universe. 

I cannot imagine that this is uncommon. Information is easy to get to, and we’re inundated by it enough that in many instances we don’t even need to exercise the fingers to get it. When we go to a movie, we often go with a trailer in our mind, some article from the AV Club or Huffpost, maybe a rant on Facebook from a future brother-in-law. 

This latter is now a daily part of my world. He’s a bigger geek than I am.

We cannot consume media without having a background. Not unless we have invested in a very heavy rock under which to live. I’ve yet to find a rock solid enough. We could easily shut ourselves off from social media and ignore the Mighty Cult of the Snoo, but as much as we bitch and moan about the shit the internet brings into our lives we do no such thing, because we’re a little bit afraid that Descartes was a little premature. I post, therefore I am.

Which is why the fourth wall is more of a fourth window screen. The holes aren’t so much a flaw as a feature of the thing itself. Product placement isn’t even half of it. Product placement is too old a term for it, hype is an anachronism. It’s totally viral, dude. 

This isn’t a hipster soapbox I’m on. The soap isn’t organic. There is no sprouted buckwheat here. I don’t bemoan this, I reflect on it. I think it is the new way to consume, the way things are done now. These projects require more, and the measure of success is how long they wrap people in their whole message. It’s not about the fourth wall. You should simply watch anymore, passively. You should be researching, should be engaged, should be dribbling hashtags in between handfuls of popcorn. 

Or you should find a really good rock.
